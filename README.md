## Project Overview

This repo contains small exercises, sample projects, and snippets demonstrating LINQ queries, operators, and patterns in C#. It's useful for learners who want hands-on practice with query syntax, method syntax, deferred execution, and LINQ providers.

## System configuration (recommended)

These are suggested system components and versions known to work well with .NET / C# LINQ exercises. Adjust as needed for your environment.

- Operating System:
  - Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, or a recent Linux distribution (Ubuntu 20.04+ / Fedora 34+)
- CPU / Memory:
  - 64-bit CPU, 4+ cores recommended
  - 4 GB RAM minimum, 8+ GB recommended for development workloads
- .NET SDK:
  - .NET 9.0 SDK (recommended) or .NET 8.0/6.0/7.0 if you require LTS/compatibility
  - Verify installed SDKs with: `dotnet --list-sdks`
- IDE / Editor:
  - Visual Studio 2022 (Windows) or Visual Studio 2022/2023 for macOS
  - Visual Studio Code (cross-platform) with C# extension (OmniSharp)
- Terminal / Shell:
  - PowerShell (Windows), Windows Terminal, macOS Terminal, or bash/zsh (Linux)
- Optional tools:
  - Git (for source control)
  - dotnet-format (for consistent formatting): `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-format`

## Prerequisites
